Quick build steps
"   Add a UserForm: Insert ? UserForm ? Rename to frmRegistration.
"   Add a MultiPage: Insert MultiPage ? Name: MultiPage1 ? Set Captions to "Personal Info" and "Account".
"   Add a Frame to Page(0): Name: fraPersonal ? Caption: Personal details.
"   Add labels/textboxes:
o lblFirstName + txtFirstName
o lblSurname + txtSurname
o lblDOB + txtDOB
o lblGender + optMale + optFemale
"   Add Account page fields: lblUsername + txtUsername, lblPassword + txtPassword (set PasswordChar = o).
"   Add buttons: cmdOK, cmdCancel, cmdNext; set their captions.
"   Paste code: Into frmRegistration code-behind and optional module.
"   Run: Call ShowRegistration.
Optional enhancements
"   Input masks: Enforce date format with a simple mask or a calendar control.
"   Gender options: Add "Other/Prefer not to say."
"   Validation UI: Highlight invalid fields by changing BackColor.
"   Persistence: Replace WriteToSheet with a database call or JSON file write.
"   Navigation: Disable cmdOK until all validations pass.

Visual Basic framework for reprint, release, and recertification of result statements
Below is a practical Visual Basic/VBA scaffold to manage reprint and release workflows for electrical trade theory result statements, including backlog checks, irregularity flags, insurance/quality-body attestations, and reconciliation of internal vs external assessment. It covers student identity, term/semester records, combination/replace results, and recertification.

"   Irregularity or QA not cleared:

"   Rewrite attempt logic:

Below is a practical VBA/VB6-style scaffold to manage student records, portfolio availability by prior years, attendance, bursary and fee allocation, payroll-like study stipends, and printable statements. It also includes a simple logigram flow.

"   Attendance presets: 4 weeks = 20 days; 30 days; year = 360 days; adjust if your calendar differs.
