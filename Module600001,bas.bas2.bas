That 's an impressive and strategically diverse portfolio of applications, Tshingombe. You're clearly positioning yourself across both technical and intelligence domains-engineering, cybercrime, surveillance, and policy advisory-while anchoring your expertise in compliance, operational rigor, and legal reform. Here's a quick breakdown to help you reflect, prioritize, or even refine your follow-ups:
???Application Landscape Overview
Domain  Sample Roles    Strategic Fit
Engineering & Technical Ops LFR Engineering Supervisor, Infrastructure/DevOps Engineer, Development (Mechanical) Engineer   Aligns with your electrical engineering background and modular systems expertise
Counter Terrorism & Intelligence    CTSA, Intelligence Officer (DC/PC), TSU Planner, AV Ops, Met Intel 24/7 roles   Leverages your compliance automation, surveillance integration, and legal mapping skills
Policing & Investigations   Detective Sergeant/Inspector roles, Economic Crime, Homicide Team   Strong fit for your legal reform advocacy and evidence-based audit trail work
Digital & Cybercrime    Digital Investigator (DMI), Cyber Crime PC  Matches your interest in credential transparency and digital compliance engines
Policy & Strategy   Tactical Policy Advisor, Safety Camera Prosecutions Manager Ideal for your systemic reform goals and regulatory alignment capabilities
Administrative & Coordination   Hub Coordination Manager, Centralised Admin Team Member Supports your multi-agency workflow and logigram documentation efforts
?? Strategic Suggestions
"   Prioritize roles that allow you to deploy your VBA-driven compliance engines or logigram workflows-especially those in CT Policing HQ, Economic Crime, or Technical Surveillance.
"   Track communications and review statuses for roles that intersect with your long-term goal of legacy-grade frameworks (e.g., CTSA, Disclosure Support, NIE).
"   Consider bundling your applications into a thematic portfolio when following up-e.g., "Compliance Automation & Intelligence Integration" or "Engineering for Counter-Terrorism Operations."
"   Prepare modular documentation that can be adapted across these roles: audit trail templates, inspection routines, and legal mapping artifacts.
Would you like help drafting a follow-up email, organizing your application tracker, or preparing tailored interview briefs for any of these roles? I can also help you build a cross-role competency matrix to showcase your transdisciplinary edge.
Excel VBA toolkit for tracking applications, statuses, and follow-ups
You 're juggling a wide, strategic spread of roles. Here's a compact, modular Excel VBA system to track applications, log communications, map domains, and generate tailored follow-ups or portfolio summaries. It's designed to be dropped into a single workbook and expanded as you go.

How to use
1.  Press Alt+F11, insert three Modules, paste the code sections.
2.  Back in Excel, run Init to create tables and validation.
3.  Use Seed_Examples or start adding via AddApplication from the Immediate Window, or directly in the Applications table.
4.  Use DraftFollowUpEmail to generate a personalized draft in Output. Optionally run CreateOutlookDraft to open it in Outlook for review.
5.  Use GeneratePortfolioSummary and SnapshotByDomain to produce concise overviews aligned to your themes.
Extend it to your edge
"   Compliance attach: Add columns for "RegulatoryHooks" and "EvidenceBundleRef" to map each role to your OHS/SANS modules and case-pack locations.
"   Scoring: Add a numeric "FitScore" with a simple formula (e.g., weighted by Domain, Priority, and Location) and expose a Rank macro to prioritize follow-ups.
"   Artifacts library: Add a sheet "Artifacts" with paths to templated audit trails, inspection routines, and legal mapping diagrams; link by PortfolioTheme for one-click packaging.
If you want, tell me two roles you're prioritizing this week and I'll tailor the DraftFollowUpEmail content and a mini "evidence pack" checklist for each.
Excel VBA logigram generator for application prioritization
You want a visual "algorigram/logigram" you can programmatically build and update. This VBA toolkit turns rows in Excel into a flowchart with auto-layout, coloring by priority/fit, and connectors showing your decision paths.
Data structure
Create two sheets:
"   Applications:
o id, RoleTitle, employer, domain, Location, ClosingDate, Priority, ReviewStatus, NextAction, FitScore, stage, ParentID
"   Flow:
o   NodeID, Label, Type, Level, Order, ParentID, LinkText, Status
Notes:
"   Stage examples: Intake, Screen, Apply, FollowUp, Interview, Offer, Close.
"   Type examples: Start, Decision, Process, Terminator, Data.
"   ParentID links a node to its upstream node.

Thanks for sharing this extensive list, Tshingombe. You're clearly navigating a high-volume, multi-domain application strategy across technical, intelligence, and operational roles. To help you visualize and manage this complexity, here's a tailored Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) program that builds a logigram (algorigram)-a flowchart-style diagram-directly in Excel, mapping your applications by domain, priority, and review status.
?? VBA Logigram Generator for Application Mapping
This code creates a dynamic flowchart in Excel based on your application data. Each role becomes a node, grouped by domain and stage, with connectors showing progression or dependencies.
?? Sheet Setup
Create a sheet named Applications with these columns:
ID  RoleTitle   Employer    Domain  Stage   Priority    ReviewStatus    NextAction  ParentID
"   Stage: Intake, Screening, Applied, Interview, Offer, Closed
"   ParentID: Optional-use to link roles (e.g., internal progression or thematic bundles)

1.  Open Excel and press Alt+F11 to open the VBA editor.
2.  Insert a new module and paste the code above.
3.  Create a sheet named Applications with the required columns.
4.  Fill in your roles, stages, and priorities.
5.  Run BuildLogigram from the Macros menu.
?? Optional Enhancements
"   Add a FitScore column and color nodes by score.
"   Use Domain to group nodes vertically or by color.
"   Add a NextActionDate to highlight urgent follow-ups.
"   Export the diagram to PowerPoint using Shapes.Copy.
Would you like me to generate a pre-filled Excel template with your current roles and stages mapped into this logigram format? I can also help you build a scoring engine to rank applications by strategic fit, urgency, and compliance alignment.
Thanks for staying focused, Tshingombe. Based on your request for a Visual Basic program to generate a logigram (algorigram)-a structured diagram showing decision paths, application stages, or compliance flows-here's a clean, modular VBA solution tailored for Excel.
This version is optimized for your multi-role application tracking, and can be adapted to visualize:
"   Application stages (e.g. Intake ? Screening ? Interview ? Offer)
"   Compliance workflows (e.g. Permit Issuance ? Audit Trail ? Legal Review)
"   Role clusters (e.g. CTSA, Engineering, Intelligence)
?? VBA Logigram Generator (Excel-based)
?? Step 1: Prepare Your Sheet
Create a sheet named LogigramData with these columns:
NodeID  Label   Stage   ParentID    Priority    Status
"   Stage: Used to group nodes vertically (e.g. Intake, Applied, Interview)
"   ParentID: Optional-connects nodes to predecessors
"   Priority: Critical, High, Medium, Low
"   Status: Submitted, Under Review, Shortlisted, Rejected, etc.
?? Step 2: Paste This VBA Code into a Module

Excel VBA toolkit for data visualization and logigramming
You want "data visual programmation" with a practical, fast-start toolkit. Here's a compact Excel/VBA setup that lets you:
"   Build charts and a dashboard from tabular data.
"   Generate a heatmap for time patterns.
"   Render a logigram (algorigram) for process stages.
Use this for applications, compliance workflows, or a crime-report pipeline (e.g., Intake ? Triage ? Investigation ? Outcome).
Data structure
Create these sheets and columns:
"   Data
o ref, Date, area, subarea, category, SubCategory, stage, Priority, Status, Value
"   Dashboard
o   Leave blank (charts will be placed here)
"   LogigramData
o nodeID, label, stage, ParentID, Priority, Status
tip:
"   Stage examples: Intake, Triage, Investigation, Review, Outcome, Closed.
"   Priority: Critical, High, Medium, Low.
Module a: pivot Tables And charts
This creates pivot tables and charts on Dashboard: counts by Category, trend over time, and Area breakdown.

How to use
1.  In Excel, add the Applications sheet with the listed headers.
2.  Press Alt+F11, insert a Module, paste the code.
3.  Optional: Run SeedSARB to preload your roles.
4.  Run DrawSARBLogigram to generate the diagram on a "Logigram" sheet.
Optional tweaks
"   Color nodes by Priority: add a Priority column and swap StatusFill with a PriorityColor function.
"   Add Stage lanes: Intake, Screening, Interview, Offer - replace LaneOffset logic to map stages.
"   Export to PowerPoint: copy shapes from the Logigram sheet and paste to a slide for briefings.
If you want, tell me which two roles you want highlighted and I'll add priority coloring and a follow-up deadline banner to the nodes.

Thanks for surfacing your saved job alerts, Tshingombe. This list reveals a highly curated strategy across engineering, energy systems, policy, and institutional transformation-each alert acting like a modular sensor scanning for openings aligned to your reform goals.
Let's turn this into a logigram-style overview to visualize how your alerts map to your career domains and strategic priorities.
?? Saved Alerts Breakdown
Alert Name  Focus Areas Strategic Fit
Engineering electrical, policy management system information recruitment, metering  Grid systems, compliance, recruitment   Matches your interest in modular compliance engines and metering logic
Engineering electrical, science engineering transport   Mobility, infrastructure, diagnostics   Aligns with your engineering diagnostics and transport reform
Engineering electrical Education technologie trade  TVET, edtech, vocational systems    Perfect for your curriculum architecture and credential transparency
Engineering electrical citypower Eskom, chain supplies, financial megawatts Energy utilities, supply chain, finance Strong fit for your megawatt-level compliance and audit trail logic
Engineering /manufacturing bank note processor  Manufacturing, currency systems Connects to your work in regulatory mapping and institutional workflows
Engineering, police Assessment Portfolio    Security sector, assessment, reform Directly aligned with your paralegal hooks and policing information systems
Engineering electrical  General scan    Broad coverage for technical roles across sectors
?? Suggested VBA Logigram: Alert Tracker
You can build a logigram in Excel to visualize:
"   Each alert as a node
"   Connected domains (e.g., "Energy" ? "Policy" ? "Recruitment")
"   Status (active, expired, modified)
"   Next action (e.g., "Review Eskom openings", "Update Education alert")
Would you like me to generate the VBA code for this logigram? I can also help you build a scoring system to rank alerts by strategic fit, urgency, and opportunity density.
Alternatively, I can help you convert these alerts into a targeted application matrix-so you know exactly which portfolios to prepare when a matching role appears. Just say the word.
